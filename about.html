                <p>I'm a 28 year old junior developer from Southern California. I've been interested in computers for as long
                    as I can remember, and the 'tech guy' for my whole family for about as long. In my spare time I enjoy
                    Hearthstone and IPAs.

                <h3>Data Entry/Order Processing</h3>
                <h5>Trinity International Industries</h5>
                <p>Every day I would process hundreds of orders from major retailers such as Home Depot, Amazon, and Wayfair.
                    If an order was large enough I would create a BOL and set up a pick-up schedule. I was also in charge
                    of invoicing using Quickbooks. If I had enough time at the end of the day I would go to the warehouse
                    and pull orders to label them for shipment.

                <h5>Style of Optics, Inc.</h5>
                <p>A bulk of my responsibility here is to make sure we're adding products to our site in a timely manner. I
                    also do these things that we call 'Availability Checks': that's when a customer wants to see if a frame
                    is available before ordering. As such, I stay in contact with many manufacturers such as Luxottica, Marchon,
                    and Safilo to make sure we're offering only what's available.
